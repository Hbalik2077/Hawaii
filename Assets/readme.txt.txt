This pack contains, what I called 'Pause bug' which I couldn't really track, i found only one corellation and it was happening 8/10 times when jumping, 
tried looking on stackoverflow, some gamedev discords and forums, reviews tikidevkit at unity asset store, or other's people recruitment git files and there was no resolution to this bug.
Tried to fix it on my own but ended up crashing code or not fixing it at every attempt.
I am terribly sorry for sending you file with this bug but there is nothing I can do to fix it, hopefully when we'll meet at the interview you can explain it to me, so I'll 
understand how to avoid such things while working together at your company.
